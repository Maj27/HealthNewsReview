# HealthNewsReview
In this work, we determine the quality of online health news automatically using natural language processing and machine learning. 
We used a dataset and criteria established by HealthNewsReview organization. 
We trained machine learning models to score the proposed quality metrics automatically using a range of different lexical features. 
We aimed to understand which criteria can be learned just with simple features, which might be amenable to more sophisticated features (as a next step) and which were actually beyond the reach of such approaches (generally due to world-knoweldge dependence).
